      <p>hap·tic [ˈhaptik]</p>
      <p>adj. relating to the sense of touch, in particular relating to the perception and manipulation of objects using the senses of touch and proprioception.</p>

      <p>The Problem</p>
      <p>The universe we live in is very big and has a lot of moving parts. “We are trapped on a very thin slice of perception” (David Eagleman).  We only see a 
      tiny percentage of colors. There are cell phone signals passing through us every moment and we are completely blind to it. The problem isn’t that these 
      things are unseeable. The problem is we aren’t equip with the sensors to pick up these things.</p>

      <p>The Brain</p>
      <p>Our brains are master data interpreters. Whatever data is given it, it figures out how to read it. Electrical signals from our eyes, ears, nose, tongue 
      and nerves are converted into an interpretation of the world around us. “Due to the brain's remarkable flexibility, there is the possibility of leveraging
      entirely new data streams directly into perception” (Hawkins and Blakeslee, 2007; Eagleman, 2015).</p>

      <p>Sensory Substitution Devices (SSDs)</p>
      <p>SSDs start feeding the brain data patterns in unconventional ways but over time our brains learn to interpret those patterns as well. 
      One example a multi-motor wristband was developed that uses machine learning to listen for specific high-frequency phonemes.</p>

      <p>Sensory Addition</p>
      <p>Vests to help the deaf can be built 40 times cheaper than cochlear implants. The blind can wear devices that… More than just sensory substitution
      but sensory addition. These devices can input any stream of data into our brains. We can input info about the stock market, pilot data, economics, 
      social media feedback, personal health, infrared ultraviolet, etc etc. Our world is so data heavy and finding senses that help us interpret that data 
      with be life changing. One developer created a sensory addition device using a haptic wristband that translates electromagnetic fields into vibrations.</p>

      <p>Wrap Up</p>
      <p>A world is detectable that previously was not: palpable shapes live around microwave ovens, computer fans, speakers, and subway power transformers.</p>

      </ul>
      <h3>Possibilities</h3>
      <p>University devised a belt called the feelSpace to allow humans to tap into that signal. The belt is ringed with vibratory motors, and the motor 
      pointed to the north buzzes. As you turn your body, you always feel the buzzing in the direction of magnetic north.</p>

      <p>Note that one won't have to wear a belt for long: researchers have recently developed a thin electronic skin—essentially a little sticker on the 
      hand—that indicates north.</p>
 
      <p>With a sensory addition device, a pilot can feel the high-dimensional stream of data instead of having to read all the data visually.</p>

      <p>As a related example, researchers at our laboratory are piloting a system to allow doctors to sense the vitals of a patient without having to 
      visually consult a variety of monitors. This device connects a haptic wristband to an array of sensors that measure body temperature, blood oxygen 
      saturation, heart rate, and heart rate variability.</p>

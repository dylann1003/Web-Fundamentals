      <p>hap·tic [ˈhaptik]</p>
      <p>adj. relating to the sense of touch, in particular relating to the perception and manipulation of objects using the senses of touch and proprioception.</p>

      <p>The Problem</p>
      <p>“We are trapped on a very thin slice of perception” (David Eagleman). We only see a tiny percentage of colors, sounds, and feelings. There are cellphone and radio signals we cannot hear and colors cannot see. These things are not unseeable. The problem is we are not naturally equipt with the sensors to pick them up.</p>

      <p>The Brain</p>
      <p>Our brains are master data interpreters; it figures out how to read any data it is given. Electrical signals from our eyes, ears, and nerves are converted into interpretations of the world around us. “Due to the brain's remarkable flexibility, there is the possibility of leveraging entirely new data streams directly into perception” (Hawkins and Blakeslee, 2007; Eagleman, 2015).</p>

      <p>Sensory Substitution Devices (SSDs)</p>
      <p>SSDs start feeding the brain data patterns in unconventional ways, such as vibrations on the skin. Over time our brains learn to read these patterns. For example, a wristband was developed that uses machine learning to listen to sounds and translate it into a vibration pattern on the wrist. People who wear the wristband, over time, can "hear" what is around them. Vests to help the deaf can be built 40 times cheaper than cochlear implants. The blind can wear devices that… </p>

      <p>Sensory Addition</p>
      <p>With this technology, what data can be added to our perception? The brain can learn to interpret any data not just data from the five senses. Information about the stock market, pilot data, economic systems, personal health, and infrared or ultraviolet light could all become part of our perception. Our world is so data heavy. Finding senses that interpret that data will be life-changing.</p>

      <p>Wrap Up</p>
      <p>A world is detectable that previously was not: palpable shapes live around microwave ovens, computer fans, speakers, and subway power transformers.</p>

      <h3>Possibilities</h3>
      <p>Explore a few of the endless possibilities for haptic technology.</p>
      <p>Researchers at Osnabrück University devised a belt called the feelSpace to allow humans to tap into the Earth's magnetic field. The belt is rigged with vibratory motors, and the motor pointed to the north buzzes. As you turn your body, you always feel the buzzing in the direction of magnetic north.</p>

      <p>One won't have to wear a belt for long: researchers have recently developed a thin electronic sticker worn on the hand—that indicates north. This could improves people sense of direction exponential.</p>
 
      <p>With a sensory addition device, a pilot can feel the high-dimensional stream of data instead of having to read all the data visually.</p>

      <p>Researchers are piloting a system that allows doctors to sense the vitals of a patient without having to visually consult a variety of monitors. This device connects a haptic wristband to an array of sensors that measure body temperature, blood oxygen saturation, heart rate, and heart rate variability.</p>

        <p>Researchers at Osnabrück University devised a belt called the feelSpace to allow humans to tap into the Earth's magnetic field. The belt is rigged with vibratory motors, and the motor pointed to the north buzzes. As you turn your body, you always feel the buzzing in the direction of magnetic north. </p>

        <p>People will not have to wear a belt for long: researchers have recently developed a thin electronic sticker worn on the hand—that indicates north. Studies show this significantly increases people's sense of direction. These could become a normal accessory for individuals.</p>

        <p>With a sensory addition device, a pilot could feel a high-dimensional stream of data instead of having to read all the data visually. This would safe pilots time and allow them to make quicker decisions.</p>

        <p>Researchers are piloting a system that allows doctors to sense the vitals of a patient without having to visually consult a variety of monitors. This device connects a haptic wristband to an array of sensors that measure body temperature, blood oxygen saturation, heart rate, and heart rate variability. </p>
